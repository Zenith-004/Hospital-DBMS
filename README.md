## 🧠 How It Works

Under the hood, this system uses:

- 🗃️ **CSV files** to persist data (like a lightweight database!)
- 🔁 A loop-driven **menu system** for navigation
- ⚠️ Input validation to catch typos and errors
- ✨ Clean, formatted output so you’re not staring at a wall of text

It’s like your own little digital register book, but cooler and coded by you 💻✨
